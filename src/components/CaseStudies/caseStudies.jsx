            Booking the best and affordable Property for the vacation was a
            problem for people and handling the large number of booking requests
            was a real challenge for property managers. The client needed a
            solution to address the issues of both property managers and people.

              A system was developed to register/onboard the property managers
              and list their properties.
            </li>
            <li>
              A unique email address is provided to the property managers. We
              have configured the email details in the database.
            </li>
            <li>
              A user booking the property for vacation enters the request on the
              property managerâ€™s website.
            </li>
            <li>
              User-entered data is sent via a forwarded email to the property
              manager as per the format.
            </li>
            <li>
              The system parses the email and stores it in a centralized system.
            </li>
            <li>
              A centralized database with all the property data updates
              regularly from the property reservation management system
              (ESCAPIA, ISLink, RMS, RNS) through a web API call.
            </li>
            <li>
              We process the parsed information using the centralized database
              to calculate rent/cost, availability, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              If no property is available as per the request, we look for the
              nearest available property based on user requirements.
            </li>
            <li>
              We use SendGrid web API to send mass emails with all the requested
              information (property quotes).
